Readme- New Orleans-class Heavy cruiser

OK, this is a hobby, so the model I've made isn't perfect. Understanding, that I hope you get some enjoyment from it. 

I made this lo-res model to help fill out fleet scenes since superb models of carriers, battleships and destroyers are available- but not every campaign had a dozen battleships prowling around.

The zipped package includes...
1. simple model in obj format
2. mapped materials with textures (CA44 USS Vincennes) for hull and superstructure.
